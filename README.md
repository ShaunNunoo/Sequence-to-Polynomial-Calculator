# Sequence-to-Polynomial-Calculator
Converts a sequence of numbers into a polynomial equation that maps onto each point
evey 1 unit.

How to Use:
- In the main method, enter a series of numbers in the vector called "elements".
- The terminal will output the corresponding coordinates to the sequence and its 
  mapping polynomial equation.
  
Note: 
The more numbers in teh sequence, the less accurate the resulting function will 
be due to floating point errors.

Enjoy!
